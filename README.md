## Required Reading

In order to understand the C++ platform API, one must first be familiar with the [OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and
[terminology](http://opentracing.io/spec/) more generally. This is a C++98 API that is used as a "common denominator".
ÃŽt is up to implementors to choose the C++ level they are going to use for their implementations:

## Compile and install

```
libtoolize # or glibtoolize
./autogen.sh
./configure
sudo make install
```

#### Tests

Testing requires the use of `gtest`. The gtest library is added as a submodule to this repository. To build all of the
tests, from the root repository:

```
cd ./thirdparty && ./build_gtest.sh
cd ../test && make
./test
```

## API overview for those adding instrumentation

Clients of this `OpenTracing` package do need to understand only the key abstractions of this API:
    * Installing a Tracer implmementation in `main()`
    * Using the Global `Tracer` to create `Spans` and `SpanContexts`
    * Adding tags, logs, or baggage to `Spans`

See the detailed [usage](./docs/usage.md) documentation for details.
